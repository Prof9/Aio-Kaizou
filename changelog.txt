v2.1 - 3 September 2022
 *  Fixed a minor text alignment inconsistency in the English version.
 *  Fixed a white line showing up in the Japanese description of certain cards.

v2.0 - 28 August 2022
 *  Buttons changed to L / R: you can now both decrease and increase the card
    number, rather than only increase it.
 *  The All-In-One ModCards now show the full effect names. To achieve this,
    extra code and text data is written to the end of the save file (behind all
    normal save data).
 *  Now plays a sound effect when the card number is changed.
 *  Each All-In-One ModCard now only lets you choose the card numbers that can
    actually go into that address legitimately. Similarly, it only lets you
    choose the Soul ModCards that can be used in your game's version
    legitimately.
 *  Due to technical changes, now you only need to choose between Japanese or
    English when choosing your ROM version.

v1.1 - 10 December 2017
 *  Add compatibility for European version.

v1.0 - 8 December 2017
 *  Initial release.
